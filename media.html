  Transcript:
  Today, we are going to be making brownies. First, preheat to 350 degrees. Next, collect your ingredients. For the mix you are going to need 1 cup of unsalted butter, or a stick, 2 cups of granulated sugar, 4 large eggs, 1 cup of flour, and 12-14 ounces of hershey syrup. I like to first mix my butter, sugar, eggs, and syrup together. Next, I like to add my flour. Once you have your complete mix, put into a greased and floured pan, and bake it until a toothpick comes out uncovered in batter. Usually, this is about 20 to 30 minutes depending on your oven. After you pull your brownies out, let them cool. Now we will make our frosting. To make the frosting, we will need 2 cups of sugar, 1 cup butter, a teaspoon of vanilla, half a cup of milk, and one small package of chocolate chips. First, we will boil the sugar, butter, vanilla, and milk for one minute. Once that comes to a boil, remove from the stove, and add the bag of chocolate chips. Now, you are going to beat your frosting until you can see the ridges in the frosting from the beater. Pour the frosting on top of your cooled brownies, let those sit for at least 10 minutes to cool, before cutting into squares and serving. Enjoy!
