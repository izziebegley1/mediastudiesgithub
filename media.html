Man 1: I made a lot of bad bets with my friends as a kid. Things like can you pick this lock? Can you beat this video game? One of the ones I regret most is can you solve this Rubik’s cube? The stakes were high. This is when we were really getting into our commodore machines and we bet a box worth of floppy disks. When I made this bet I thought I could go to the library and really figure out how to solve this cube. But after spending two hours, maybe three, sitting in the library turning that cube and trying to get it right, I couldn’t figure it out. I put the book down in disgust and realized I was going to lose a box of floppy disks. Then, a dark thought crossed my mind. Perhaps, I wasn’t going to lose a box of floppy disks. Perhaps, I could solve the cube with a more unconventional way. That’s right. I decided I was going to do one of two things. I was going to take my Rubik’s cube apart or I was going to take the stickers off and reapply them. At first glance, I thought the stickers thing might be easier, but then, it occurred to me that they may lose their stickability and I wouldn’t be able to put them back on. So, I went home, grabbed a screwdriver, and started trying to pry the Rubik’s cube apart. Now, since then, I have properly learned to take a Rubik’s cube apart, you sort of give it a quarter turn and then you can pop the pieces off. Back then, I started to just take the cube and jab a screwdriver into the center cube. Which, I thought, wasn’t attached to the base and soon it wouldn’t be so I payed upward and that center piece popped in the air. I have busted my Rubik’s cube in an attempt to score some floppy disks. The real weird thing about this is I decided not to bring it up to my friends and they didn’t either so the bet itself went nowhere which was often the case with our bets. You take them seriously and then people kind of forget about them when something else would happen. But I had a constant reminder with my busted Rubik’s cube. It would be a few years before I was able to pick another one up at a garage sale and I would work on that one, failing most of the time. Until, I finally figured it out and now I can solve a Rubik’s cube without  breaking it or removing the stickers. I don’t know why I am so fascinated with the Rubik’s cube but I always have been. Maybe it’s the puzzle? Maybe it’s the colors? Maybe it was the cartoon I was obsessed during it’s brief run. I’m not sure. But on today’s show, we are going to talk about the cartoon, Rubik the amazing cube. We’ll talk about the people behind the camera, people doing the voices, plot, the shows all to brief run, the theme song, and where you can find Rubik the amazing cube today. We have an info- pact episode ahead of us so, without further ado, let’s start the show. 
Theme music plays: until 4:07
